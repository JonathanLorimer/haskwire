## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### üõ†Ô∏è Development

This repo depends on nix, and uses `nix-shell` to setup a dev environment. To setup nix on your setup please visit the [getting nix page](https://nixos.org/download.html). This repo uses cabal to build the haskell dependencies, but all of the dependencies are provided via the nix-shell.

There are several utility scripts provided by the nix-shell:
  - `ref` - This rebuilds the dependencies using cabal, you will have to run this after editing the `package.yaml` file.
  - `dev` - Runs `ghcid` for the haskwire library
  - `dev-test` - Runs `ghcid` for the test suite
  - `run` - Runs the demo server
  - `run-test` - Executes the test suite
  - `format` - Formats all hs files with `ormolu`

The nix shell also provides these haskell tools:
  - cabal
  - haskell-language-server
  - ghcid
  - ormolu

A typical workflow might look like this:

```bash
nix-shell
dev
```

### ‚ú® Running the demo app

nix-shell should also provide the correct version of `node` for you, and `yarn`. We just need to install the turbo client js and es-build to bundle our javascript.

```bash
nix-shell
cd demo/hotwire-client
yarn
yarn build
cd ../..
run
```

you should see this output in your terminal:

```bash
Œªüîå Running haskwire demo on port 8081 ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
```
